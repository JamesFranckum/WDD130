        <p>Hello fellow classmates my name is James Franckum!  I am a treasure hunting major with a minor in cartography</p>
        <p>Part of this major is that I have to pretend to say that I am a software engineering major who is learning Chinese to help keep my secrete safe. 
            I enjoy outdoor photography and have had the opertunity to vist a few really cool places.  Some of my favorite places that I have been to 
        thus far are the California Red Woods, and the granite planes of Yosemite National Park.</p>
        <p>I am very exicted to see where this class will take me and I really enjoy learning new things.  This is one of the reasons that I chose
            this class was to have the ablity to create, and make new things!  I am also glad to be here at the BYUI campus.  I think sometimes it is 
            seen of as the middle child between Provo and Hawaii campuses, yet I have loved being here and have met some amaxing people here.  
            let us have a great semester.
        </p>
