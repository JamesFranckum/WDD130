    <!--When working with images there are a few things that we can do to make them visable, high quality, and open fast enough so that our users are not frustrated with the speed.
    1 we need to make sure that our image is a file that other people can open like jpeg and png
    2 You can crop the image before an up load
    3 you can test the quality of your page with google page speed insights to see how well you are doing
    4 pixlr_editor.com is pretty good for editing photos and reducing their quality before you input it
